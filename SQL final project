We're going to work with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and 
customers.

#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT CustomerID,FirstName,LastName,Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country != 'USA' ;

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerID,FirstName,LastName,Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country = 'Brazil' ;

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName,cust.LastName,inv.invoiceid,inv.BillingCountry,inv.InvoiceDate 
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.CustomerID = inv.CustomerID
WHERE cust.country = 'Brazil';

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.employees 
WHERE Title LIKE '%Sales Support Agent%';

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT em.FirstName,em.LastName,inv.InvoiceId FROM chinook.employees em
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cu
ON  em.EmployeeId = cu.SupportRepid
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cu.customerid = inv.customerid
WHERE em.Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId) 
FROM chinook.invoices WHERE InvoiceDate 
BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9 What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT invi.UnitPrice, invi.Quantity, (invi.UnitPrice *COUNT(invi.Quantity)) AS totalsale FROM chinook.invoices inv
INNER JOIN chinook.invoice_items invi
ON inv.invoiceid = invi.invoiceid
WHERE inv.InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name,inv.InvoiceLineId 
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON inv.trackid = t.trackid;

#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name,inv.InvoiceLineId,ar.name 
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks t ON inv.trackid = t.trackid
JOIN chinook.albums al ON al.albumid = t.albumid
JOIN chinook.artists ar ON ar.artistid = al.artistid ;

#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS trackname,al.Title AS albumname,m.Name AS media,g.Name AS genre FROM chinook.tracks t
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums al ON t.Albumid = al.Albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.media_types m ON t.MediaTypeid = m.MediaTypeid 
LEFT JOIN chinook.genres g ON t.Genreid =g.Genreid ;

#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.FirstName,e.LastName,SUM(i.Total ) AS totalsale  FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c ON i.Customerid = c.Customerid
JOIN (SELECT * FROM chinook.employees 
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent') e ON c.SupportRepid = e.Employeeid GROUP BY E.FirstName ;

#4 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName,e.LastName,SUM(i.Total ) AS totalsale FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c ON i.Customerid = c.Customerid
JOIN (SELECT * FROM chinook.employees 
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent') e ON c.SupportRepid = e.Employeeid 
WHERE i.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'GROUP BY e.FirstName ORDER BY totalsale DESC LIMIT 1;

#15 what is name of the tracks sold by sales agents?
SELECT e.FirstName,e.LastName,t.Name FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c ON i.Customerid = c.Customerid
JOIN chinook.employees e ON c.SupportRepid = e.Employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ii ON i.Invoiceid = ii.invoiceid
JOIN chinook.tracks t ON ii.Trackid = t.Trackid;
