##We've created a database for customers and their orders. Not all of the customers have made orders, however. Come up with a query that lists the name and email of every customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made. Use a LEFT OUTER JOIN so that a customer is listed even if they've made no orders, and don't add any ORDER BY.
##create another query that will result in one row per each customer, with their name, email, and total amount of money they've spent on orders. Sort the rows according to the total money spent, from the most spent to the least spent.

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    item TEXT,
    price REAL);

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, item, price)
    VALUES (1, "Sonic Screwdriver", 1000.00);
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, item, price)
    VALUES (2, "High Quality Broomstick", 40.00);
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, item, price)
    VALUES (1, "TARDIS", 1000000.00);

SELECT c.name,c.email,o.item,o.price
FROM customers AS c 
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders AS o
ON c.id = o.customer_id;

SELECT c.name,c.email,SUM(o.price) AS spent
FROM customers AS c 
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders AS o
ON c.id = o.customer_id GROUP BY name ORDER BY spent DESC;
